# Speech-Processing-
Evaluation of a robust multi-feature speech/music discriminator. 
- The main aim of the project was to help a classifier algorithm that we worked on, to difrentiate between Music and speech. 
- This was done by Extracting features like, **Zero crossing rate, Spectral Flux, Spectral centroid, Spectral roll off and Percentage low energy frams.**
- The outcomes were: Sucessfull Extraction of features from audio signals and building an automatic classifier to discriminate between speech and music, and Calculating the Bhattacharyya (BC) distance between the two data sets, achieved 90% correct classification.
